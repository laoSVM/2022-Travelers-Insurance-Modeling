# Introduction

This project is focused on creating a machine learning model to predict customer conversion rates for an auto insurance company. The project includes data analysis, model building, and the creation of a BI dashboard to visualize the results.

# Data

The data for this project was provided by [Travelers](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/zamnrq1n2yz/data), including customer historical and demographic information.

# Analysis

The data was cleaned and explored to identify any trends or patterns that could be used to predict conversion rates.

# Model

Several machine learning algorithms were tested and evaluated to determine the best model for the task, including lightGBM, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

The final model chosen for this project was a lightGBM. The model was trained on 70% of the data, and tested on the remaining 30% to evaluate its performance. We use cross-validation to reduce the impact of randomness in the training set.

## Feature Engineering

We were trying to improve the performance of our predictive model by incorporating new features through feature engineering. We were not sure how the benchmark model was originally trained, but we suspected that adding additional features from all datasets might help to increase its accuracy. We applied various feature engineering techniques to create new features that we thought might be useful for our model. These techniques included combining multiple datasets, creating calculated fields, and performing data aggregation.

## Feature Selection

We implemented a recursive feature selection process to identify the most important variables for our predictive model. To start, we used data visualization techniques to explore the relationships between the generated variables and conversion. This helped us to get a sense of which variables might be the most useful for our model.

Next, we applied statistical methods to eliminate features that were not important to the model. This allowed us to narrow down our list of potential variables and focus on the ones that had the most impact on model performance. These techniques included variance threshold, chi2 test, recursive feature selection, etc.

Finally, we used a feature importance plot to further refine our selection process. This plot was generated by lightGBM after the training process and showed us the relative importance of each variable in the model, and we used it to identify the most important variables to include in our final model. Overall, this recursive feature selection process helped us to identify the key variables that contributed the most to our model's performance and eliminated those that were not as important.

# Dashboard

A BI dashboard was created to visualize the results of the model and allow for easy interpretation by stakeholders. The dashboard includes four topics.

The App is deployed on Streamlit Cloud [Here](https://laosvm-2022-travelers-insurance-modeling-app-ip8h49.streamlit.app/).


# Conclusion

Overall, this project was successful in creating a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer conversion rates for an auto dealership. The BI dashboard provides a useful tool for stakeholders to understand and interpret the results of the model.

# Future Work

There are several areas for future improvement, including feature engineering, model fine tuning, etc.
